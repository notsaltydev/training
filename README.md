Let's review what you've learned so far:

    You can add headings of different sizes using the different headings elements: <h1> through <h6>.
    Paragraphs are added with the <p> element.
    Unordered lists are created with the <ul> element and list items are added using the <li> element.
    Ordered lists are created with the <ol> element and list items are added using the <li> element.
    You can add links to your web page using the <a> element - don't forget the href attribute!
    Images can be added with the <img> element - don't forget the src attribute!
    Images help support visually impaired users when <img> elements include the alt attribute.
    You can turn anything into a link by wrapping it with an <a> element.
    White space in the HTML file does not affect the positioning of elements in the browser.
    The W3C recommends 2 spaces of indentation for nested HTML elements.
    Comments are used to take notes inside of an HTML file. You can add a comment with <!-- This is a comment -->.

Let's review what you've learned so far:

1. A CSS selector targets an HTML element.

2. CSS declarations style HTML elements. Declarations must contain the following two things:

    property - the property you want to style.
    value - the value for the property you are styling.

3. CSS declarations must end in a semicolon (;)

4. A CSS rule consists of a CSS selector and the declarations inside of the selector.

5. Multiple element selectors can be used to style multiple elements at once.

6. Comments keep code easy to read and allow you to experiment with new code without having to remove old code.

7. CSS follows certain best practices for spacing and indentation:

    One line of spacing between a selector and the opening curly brace.
    No spacing between CSS declarations and the opening and closing curly braces of the CSS rule.
    Two spaces of indentation for CSS declarations.
    One line of spacing between CSS rules.
